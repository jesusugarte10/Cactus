Due to the difficult economic situation In Venezuela, the government of President Nicol√°s Maduro and the opposition are engaged in a bitter power struggle, Venezuela has been caught in an economical downward spiral with growing political discontent further fueled by skyrocketing hyperinflation, power cuts, and shortages of food and medicine. More than five million Venezuelans have left the country in recent years. On March 11, 2019, the U.S. Department of State announced the withdrawal of diplomatic personnel from U.S. Embassy Caracas. All consular services, routine, and emergency are suspended until further notice.

This very difficult situation has not only negatively affected me but all my family back in Venezuela, it has become exponentially more difficult for them to fund my education in the United States. My parents are divorced, my mother is my main source of support. Her main source of income has been strongly affected due to the pandemic situation which have led to fully shutting down the country in a biweekly basis. The economy is disrupted. As a Senior Computer Science Student, I have been able to join different clubs and organizations as well as the Appleseed Lab with Engineering research projects. I have excelled all my knowledge in Computer Science hoping to help my family back in Venezuela aim for a better future. 

The main reason I ask for aid is because my primary means of financial support come from Venezuela. I need financial support to be able to fund my last year of education at UCF. All I wish Is I could get this special opportunity to finish my professional career and seek for a better future for my family back in Venezuela. I strongly Believe that the University of Central Florida will always be a very important chapter in my whole life. This Financial Aid would be a blessing not only for me but for all my family in Venezuela.
